# WARNING
This project is not intended to be a demonstration of software quality.
This effort represents the desire to contribute to the group of people who move daily through the electric train. 
The code is available to the public for extending its functionality or improve it.
It also serves as an example of a simple and useful project developed in a short time (about 3 weeks).
Bon apetit. :)
